# Intro
"Coding is the new literacy."
But it's an odd kind of literacy, isn't it, if we're taught to write before we learn to read?

This course will use selected "readings" to provide context for topics and examples of style and "voice"---to emulate or to avoid!

# Why learn to program?
Well, that's kind of a loaded question, isn't it?
* Why learn history?
** To provide context for understanding the world.
* Why learn math?
** To provide a language for modeling to world.
* Why learn engineering?
** So that we can understand how to build tools that shape the world.
* Why learn art?
** So that we can express ideas through creative means.
* Why learn Latin?
** For mental stimulation, and to open up new literature.
* ...
* So, why learn to program?
** For all of the above!
*** Software is a context that's shaped the end of the 20th century and will pervade the 21st.
*** Programming is "executable math"---a tool for modeling the world and for realizing those models.
*** Programming is an engineering discipline, a way to create tools that anybody in the world can use.
*** Programming is a creative medium---it permits voice, style, play, and message.
*** It's fun, and it's good for your brain*!

# You're all already programmers
From time to time, somebody will repost this article, somewhere on the internet:
[sheep and goats paper].

Well, that's crap. At best, it's a test for "who has previously been exposed to a language that inherited the brain-dead choice of '=' as an assignment operator from B".

Ok, pop quiz: what does the following program do?

A1 [1]
A2 [=A1 + 1]
A3 [=A2 + 1]
...

See, you all can program already! Next time you want to impress someone, tell them you use a dynamically-typed, pure, reactive functional programming language every day at work.
