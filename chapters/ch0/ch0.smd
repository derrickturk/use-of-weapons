``Coding is the new literacy.''


But it's an odd kind of literacy, isn't it, if we're taught to write before we learn to read?


This course will use selected ``readings'' to provide context for topics and examples of style and ``voice''---to emulate or to avoid!

# why learn to program?


Well, that's kind of a loaded question, isn't it?

* Why learn history? $FRAG$
  * To provide context for understanding the world. $FRAG$
* Why learn math? $FRAG$
  * To provide a language for modeling to world. $FRAG$
* Why learn engineering? $FRAG$
  * So that we can understand how to build tools that shape the world. $FRAG$
* Why learn art? $FRAG$
  * So that we can express ideas through creative means. $FRAG$
* Why learn Latin? $FRAG$
  * For mental stimulation, and to open up new literature. $FRAG$
* ... $FRAG$


So, why learn to program?


For all of the above!

* Software is a context that's shaped the end of the 20th century and will pervade the 21st. $FRAG$
* Programming is ``executable math''---a tool for modeling the world and for realizing those models. $FRAG$
* Programming is an engineering discipline, a way to create tools that anybody in the world can use. $FRAG$
* Programming is a creative medium---it permits voice, style, play, and message. $FRAG$
* It's fun, and it's good for your brain*! $FRAG$

# what this isn't

Engineers are prone to latch on to totalizing worldviews

* Young earth creationism $FRAG$
* Radical Islam $FRAG$

... especially with charismatic figureheads $FRAG$

* Zed Shaw $FRAG$
* Eliezer Yudkowsky $FRAG$
* The Mustache Money guy $FRAG$


Bad news:

* I'm super opinionated $FRAG$

Worse news:

* You will be too $FRAG$

Good news:

* We don't need to agree. Question everything. $FRAG$


This isn't going to be dogmatic.

I'm not going to hold back from sharing opinions, but I need you to ask for evidence when I don't present it.

Call me out. It's OK!

# you're all already programmers


From time to time, somebody will repost this article, somewhere on the internet:

Well, that's crap. At best, it's a test for ``who has previously been exposed to a language that inherited the brain-dead choice of '=' as an assignment operator from FORTRAN''.

Or worse, some smartass will start a programming class by asking you what you think some program like this does:

```java
public void mystery(int x)
{
    System.out.print(x % 10);
    if ((x / 10) != 0)
        mystery(x / 10);
    System.out.print(x % 10);
}
```
This is the moral equivalent of starting a 6th grade English class by having the students read a chapter of Finnegans Wake and asking them what it means.


Ok, pop quiz: what does the following program do?

See, you all can program already!

Next time you want to impress someone, tell them you use a dynamically-typed, pure, reactive functional programming language every day at work.

In fact, tell them you use co-recursive streams for total functional programming on non-finite structures. (We just did, for realsies!)
